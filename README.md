Hi, I'm Victor Owino, a seasoned Data and Analytics professional boasting  over 3 years in the data engineering, analytics and Bussiness Intelligence (BI).  Over the years, I have developed a strong foundation in the life sciences, passion and commitment to leveraging technology and data to craft innovative data-driven solutions across diverse sectors especially in areas like healthcare, education, social impact, retail, and insurance.  I've got a knack for finding solutions, and I'm always on the lookout for new challenges in other domains.

I take pride in my strength, which lies in my ability to empower companies  and organizations with the right data, in the right format, analyzed to perfection, and transformed into actionable insights for informed decision-making. For me, creating user-centric BI Dashboards and Reports  isn't just a skill; it's my passion, turning data into insights that empower decisions. I am deeply committed to enabling everybody in an organization, irrespective of their technical know-how, to work with data comfortably, to feel confident talking about it, and, as a result, make data-informed decisions and build customer experiences powered by data. You can refer to me as a versatile data analyst who handles everything from managing the nitty-gritty data pipelines to crafting beautiful and insightful end-user dashboards. Whether working on a team or independently, I am driven by the thrill of discovering new insights and the satisfaction of using data to solve problems.

Victor led a team in  the design and implementation of a highly scalable data pipeline and BI solution from the ground up. The goal was to centralize and optimize data storage and processing, enabling the organization to harness the power of its data for advanced analytics, reporting, and business insights. The project entails an automated data pipelines, ingesting and transforming data from diverse sources into Google BigQuery, a cloud data warehouse. The project culminated in a meticulously curated and user-friendly Power BI dashboard, making data exploration and decision-making an intuitive and accessible process for stakeholders across the organization.

In my leisure hours, I enjoy waltching and playing soccer (Manchester  United Fun) and board games like Chess.  I also find relaxation in the virtual world, sometimes immersing myself in video games such as FIFA.
