Hi, I'm Victor Owino, a seasoned Data and Analytics professional boasting  over 3 years in the data engineering, analytics and Bussiness Intelligence (BI).  Over the years, I have developed a strong foundation in the life sciences, passion and commitment to leveraging technology and data to craft innovative data-driven solutions across diverse sectors especially in areas like healthcare, education, social impact, retail, and insurance.  I've got a knack for finding solutions, and I'm always on the lookout for new challenges in other domains.

I take pride in my strength, which lies in my ability to empower companies  and organizations with the right data, in the right format, analyzed to perfection, and transformed into actionable insights for informed decision-making. For me, creating user-centric BI Dashboards and Reports  isn't just a skill; it's my passion, turning data into insights that empower decisions. I am deeply committed to enabling everybody in an organization, irrespective of their technical know-how, to work with data comfortably, to feel confident talking about it, and, as a result, make data-informed decisions and build customer experiences powered by data. You can refer to me as a versatile data analyst who handles everything from managing the nitty-gritty data pipelines to crafting beautiful and insightful end-user dashboards. Whether working on a team or independently, I am driven by the thrill of discovering new insights and the satisfaction of using data to solve problems.

Victor led a team in  the design and implementation of a highly scalable data pipeline and BI solution from the ground up. The goal was to centralize and optimize data storage and processing, enabling the organization to harness the power of its data for advanced analytics, reporting, and business insights. The project entails an automated data pipelines, ingesting and transforming data from diverse sources into Google BigQuery, a cloud data warehouse. The project culminated in a meticulously curated and user-friendly Power BI dashboard, making data exploration and decision-making an intuitive and accessible process for stakeholders across the organization.

In my leisure hours, I enjoy waltching and playing soccer (Manchester  United Fun) and board games like Chess.  I also find relaxation in the virtual world, sometimes immersing myself in video games such as FIFA.

This repository is my Project Portfolio showcasing a range of technical prowess, problem-solving thought processes, and domain expertise.
# Projects
## 1.0 SQL Projects
SQL is a must-have skill for any aspiring data practitioner. Many modern companies store vast amounts of their data in various tables of relational databases. To extract the necessary data from a database for further manipulation and data analysis, you must have a good grasp of SQL. This repository serves as a showcase for my SQL projects
## 1.1 Covid 19 Data Exploration
**Code:** [COVID Portfolio Project](https://github.com/VictorOwinoKe/SQL-Porfolio-Projects-DDL-DML/blob/master/Covid19-Data-Exploration.sql)

**Description:** The dataset contains records of `Covid-19` cases, deaths and vaccine records by country in 2020-2021. This project includes the following steps: data loading, data cleaning and preprocessing and EDA (exploratory data analysis).

**Objective:** Using SQL queries to provide insights into infection rates, death percentages, and vaccination progress at both global and regional levels. The results are stored in temporary tables and views for further analysis and visualization. 

**Skills:**  `Joins`,  `CTE's`,  `Temp Tables`,  `Windows Functions`,  `Aggregate Functions`,  `Creating Views`,  `Converting Data Types`

**Technology:**  `SQL Server`

## 1.2 SQL Data Cleaning  Queries: Nashville Housing.sql
**Code:** [SQL Data Cleaning  Queries: Nashville Housing.sql](https://github.com/VictorOwinoKe/SQL-Porfolio-Projects-DDL-DML/blob/6693c44322717d07989054d09b7fb115f394d5f8/SQL%20Data%20Cleaning%20%20Queries%3A%20Nashville%20Housing.sql)

**Description:** The dataset contains a list of houses that have been sold in Nashville between 2013 and 2019. This project includes the following steps: data loading, data cleaning and preprocessing.

**Objective:** To clean and enhance the  `NashvilleHousing` data table by standardizing date formats, populating missing property addresses, breaking full addresses into individual components, converting specific values, removing duplicates, and deleting unused columns.

**Skills:**  `DML(Data Manipulation Language)`,  `DQL (Data Query Language)`,  `DDL (Data Definition Language)`.

**Technology:**  `SQL Server`

## 1.3 Student Mental EDA SQL & Python
**Code:** [Student Mental Analysis.ipynb](https://github.com/VictorOwinoKe/SQL-Porfolio-Projects-DDL-DML/blob/master/Student's%20Mental%20Health.ipynb)

**Description:** Does going to university in a different country affect your mental health? Studying abroad can be both exciting and difficult. But what might be contributing to this? A Japanese international university surveyed its students in 2018 and published a study the following year that was approved by several ethical and regulatory boards.

The study found that international students have a higher risk of mental health difficulties than the general population, and that social connectedness (belonging to a social group) and acculturative stress (stress associated with joining a new culture) are predictive of depression.

**Objective:** To explore the `students` data using SQL and Python to find out if we can come to a similar conclusion for international students and see if the length of stay is a contributing factor.

**Skills:**  `DML(Data Manipulation Language)`,  `DQL (Data Query Language)`,  `DDL (Data Definition Language)`, `Python (Pandas)`

**Technology:**  `SQL Server` , `Notebook`

## 2.0 Data Analysis Python Projects
Learning Python is crucial for anyone interested in working with data.  This repository showcases my Python projects, demonstrating my ability to analyze, manipulate and automate data analysis using python

## 3.0 Data Vizualization and Dashboards (Power BI)
Every day your business generates more data on sales revenue, marketing performance, customer interactions, inventory levels, production metrics, staffing levels, costs, and other KPIs. But with so much data to sift through, it can be difficult for people to see the story it tells.Data visualization brings data to life, making you the master storyteller of the insights hidden within your numbers. 

Below are sample projects through live data dashboards, interactive reports, charts, graphs, and other visual representations, that demostrate how we can use data visualization to helps users develop powerful business insight quickly and effectively.
